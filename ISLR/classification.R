################## Logistic Regeression ###################
# glm: glm is used to fit generalized linear models, specified by giving a 
# symbolic description of the linear predictor and a description of the error 
# distribution.

# family attribute in the glm() function means the description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. 
# binomial(link = "logit")
# gaussian(link = "identity")
# Gamma(link = "inverse")
# inverse.gaussian(link = "1/mu^2")
# poisson(link = "log")
# quasi(link = "identity", variance = "constant")
# quasibinomial(link = "logit")
# quasipoisson(link = "log")

#################### predict() ##########################
# The predict() function can be used to predict the probability that the market will go up, given values of the predictors. The type="response"
# option tells R to output probabilities of the form P(Y = 1|X), as opposed to other information such as the logit. 

# If no data set is supplied to the predict() function, then the probabilities are computed for the training
# data that was used to fit the logistic regression model

# Diagonal elements are correct predictions. That is when it was Down, and was predicted Down

mean(glm_pred == Direction) # thing inside the function creates a logical vector where R automatically assigns the Factor as True and False for up and down respectively

# Since, above prediction was based not on any new data, prediction cannot be assumed to show the true picture.

# We now fit a logistic regression model using only the subset of the observations that correspond to dates before 2005, using the subset argument. We then obtain predicted 
# probabilities of the stock market going up for each of the days in our test setâ€”that is, for the days in 2005
